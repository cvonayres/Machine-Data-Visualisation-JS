# Machine-Data-Visualisation-JS
This is a project to solve a problem in my last job; that being of how to gather data from industrial machines and also provide a website were that data can be presented in a clear and clean manager to allow visualisation of trends and performance. This is phase 1 where everthing will be done in javascript and other common webframe works.
